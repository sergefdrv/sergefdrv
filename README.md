## About Me

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sergey Fedorov, an Independent Research Engineer. I'm mostly interested in designing practical, full-featured, composable, and configurable fault-tolerant replication systems, as well as exploring clear and expressive ways to implement them. I'm also enthusiastic about exploring alternative programming models for distributed computing. I think that decentralized Byzantine-fault tolerant mechanisms will dominate in future computing systems, and I'm very excited about working towards that.

I see myself best as someone discovering smart solutions to hard problems and doing this for the common good. In that, I believe in open source, open innovation and collaboration.

This is why I decided to found [Replica_IO](https://replica-io.dev/), an open-source framework for building practical distributed replication mechanisms. If you're also excited about this initiative, feel free to contact me! Let's make a breakthrough in designing and implementing distributed replication protocols for the future of decentralized computing ðŸš€

## My Experience

I began working as a software engineer back in 2009. First 7 years, I was mostly focussed on developing low-level system software: I worked with such things as Linux kernel, microcontrollers, hardware emulation, and trusted execution. 

In 2016, I moved to Germany and joined the [Security Group](https://neclab.eu/research-areas/security) at [NEC Laboratories Europe](https://neclab.eu/) in Heidelberg, where I first got into research and development in the areas of blockchain, distributed and decentralized systems. I got absolutely excited about this, and since then, I keep exapnding my knowledge and experience in that area, in particular, designing and implementing distributed protocols.

In April 2022, I left NEC and [joined](https://research.protocol.ai/blog/2022/sergey-fedorov-joins-consensuslab-as-a-research-engineer/) the [ConsensusLab](https://research.protocol.ai/groups/consensuslab/) Group at [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/). I worked with Protocol Labs, doing research and open-source software engineering in the area of scalable decentralised consensus, until I left in February 2023. 

In March 2023, I decided to start the [Replica_IO](https://replica-io.dev/) project, something that I've been thinking about for several years, but never managed to find room for. With this project, I want to make a breakthrough in how distributed systems are designed and implemented in practice.

### Previous Projects

Here are some open-source projects I worked on:

 - [Interplanetary Consensus (IPC)](http://fil.space/#components) - a framework to enable on-demand horizontal scalability of Filecoin blockchain. My contribution includes redesign and implementation of the atomic cross-chain transaction execution protocol in Rust.
 - [Mir](http://github.com/filecoin-project/mir) - a framework for implementing, debugging, and analyzing distributed protocols. My contribution includes implementation of the checkpointing mechanism, protocol garbage collection, basic mechanism for reproducible testing with simulated time, simple benchmarks.
 - [MinBFT Hyperledger Lab](http://github.com/hyperledger-labs/minbft) - an implementation of MinBFT consensus protocol as a pluggable software component. I was the main author, contributor, and maintainer of the project.
 - [Qemu](http://qemu.org) - a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer. My contribution includes enhancing ARM emulation, enabling ARM TrustZone support, enabling multithreading support in the binary translation engine.
